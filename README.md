## ✨ Features

* **Infinite Procedural Environment:** Look out over an expansive ocean with dynamic water shaders and a continuous, procedurally generated mountain range on the horizon.
* **Dynamic Time of Day:** A smooth, interactive UI slider controls the sun/moon cycle. Watch the environmental fog, directional lighting, and ambient shadows crossfade perfectly from high-noon to a golden sunset, into a moonlit night.
* **Creative Building Engine:** 8 distinct block types including emissive lamps, translucent glass, and procedural noise-textured stone, wood, and grass.
* **World Management System:** Manage up to 10 separate worlds simultaneously using a tabbed interface. Save your creations locally as `.json` files and load them back instantly.

## 🧠 The Neural Network Generator

Unlike typical procedural generators, this project features a **custom, zero-dependency 3-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built entirely from scratch in JavaScript. 

1. **Latent Space:** Upon clicking "Generate", a random 16-dimensional latent vector is created.
2. **Forward Pass:** The vector is passed through the ANN (16 → 24 → 48 hidden nodes using ReLU activation). 
3. **Deterministic Weights:** Weight matrices are seeded deterministically per structure type (e.g., Castle, Temple, Skyscraper), ensuring architectural coherence.
4. **Procedural Decoding:** The 48-dimension output tensor is decoded into physical building instructions. 

Choose the **Abstract** option to map the raw tensor directly to the 3D grid, resulting in a 100% unique, unpredictable alien geometry every single time.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Because this project utilizes ES Modules to import Three.js, it must be run through a local web server to avoid strict MIME type and CORS errors.

### Prerequisites
You will need a basic local server. If you have Python or Node.js installed, you're ready to go.

### Installation & Execution

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/voxel-builder-unlimited.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/voxel-builder-unlimited.git)
   cd voxel-builder-unlimited
